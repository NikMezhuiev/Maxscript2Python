# MaxScript to Python Converter

## Overview

This project provides a graphical tool for converting MaxScript code into Python code. The tool is built using Python and the PySide6 framework, allowing for easy text manipulation and highlighting of code syntax. The main goal of this application is to assist developers in translating their MaxScript code to Python by providing an intuitive interface and powerful code processing capabilities.

## Features

- **Real-time Conversion:** Automatically convert MaxScript code to Python as you type.
- **Syntax Highlighting:** Separate highlighters for MaxScript and Python to differentiate the code easily.
- **Customizable Rules:** Easily mark custom functions and variables to tailor the conversion process to specific needs.
- **User-friendly Interface:** A split view editor with MaxScript on one side and the converted Python code on the other.
- **State Persistence:** Save and restore the last session's text and window state for a seamless workflow.
